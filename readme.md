# YelpCamp

https://whispering-meadow-71464.herokuapp.com/

YelpCamp website built with the help of the web developer bootcamp course by Colt Steele. It is built using the MEN stack. 
The MEN stack is MongoDB, Express and nodeJS. MongoDB is used to store the campground information with comments submitted for each.
MongoDB also stores user information which uses passportJS for password encryptment and authorization. Express is the framework 
used alongside Node.JS the Javascript runtime environment.

The premise of the website is the user can post their campgrounds as well as comment on others and their own.
First thing a user does when visiting the website is registers, and then signs in. The user then posts a campground 
to the website where they can either edit or delete the campground.
